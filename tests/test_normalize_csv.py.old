# old files are ok temporarily.  Typically though, you want to keep the space clean.
# I you think you need to refer to a file, try a `git tag`, then git remove the file.
# If you need to refer to the file just checkout the tag.
# not quite as convenient as having the file in the directory, but keep things tidy
